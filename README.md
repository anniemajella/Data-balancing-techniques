# Data-balancing-techniques
 
Data imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning, and the seminar explored various techniques and strategies for mitigating this issue. 
The "Data Balancing Techniques" was a presentation and discussion session that explored various methods and strategies for addressing data imbalance issues in data science projects. This seminar aimed to provide insights into the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets and offer practical solutions for achieving balanced data to improve model performance.
I incorporated one of the data balancing techniques into a Random Forest model for a stroke prediction dataset during the seminar
